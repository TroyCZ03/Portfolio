Hello, my name is Troy, and I'm a sophomore at the University of New Hampshire, where I am majoring in Computer Science. Here, I've been developing crucial engineering skills, particularly those vital for teamwork in the tech industry. My education has not only been about understanding complex theories and applying them to real-world problems but also about exploring the collaborative nature of technology development. I'm constantly on the lookout for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills, whether through internships, research projects, or collaborative initiatives.
